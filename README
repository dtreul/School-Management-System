FRONT END INFORMATION:

Not currently implemented:

Editing/Adding entities:

  I couldn't get this to work because I couldn't figure out how to make a form post/put to the api correctly with JSON in the body. In order to add or edit any information, please use the method described earlier by directly interacting with the API.

Error Handling:

  I didn't have time to handle all the type errors, such as entering a a non integer value in ID's or leaving entries blank.
